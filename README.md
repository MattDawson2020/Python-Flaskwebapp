## üêç Python-Flaskwebapp

- Fourth example [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Simple webapp using Flask, aimed to show how easy it is to build webapps with Python as the backend
- First use of Python virtual environment to allow isolated installation to handle dependencies


## üìì Comments

- Flask is a really brilliant framework, it is even simpler to use than Rails, but unlike Rails it doesn't hide/abstract but of the logic from you, which is better for debugging
- Similar to a node/express or Sinatra setup it allows you to directly state your routes/controllers and the correspending pages
- Building an entirely functional site using Flask seems like it would be substantially easier than any other backend framework i've used so far
- Deviated from directory setup in the tutorial, which had the python/html/css files inside a demo folder, separated from the virtual folder. However this seemed entirely unnecessary to me, as well as preventing github fro recognising the languages present in the app
- Requirements.txt was my own addition as having the virtual env pushed to github in the final repo seemed like poor practice, and I found a reccomendation to list dependencies in this way


## üíª Running the app

- Clone this repo to your local machine, navigate to the directory, and then use ``` cd demo  && virtual/Scripts/python script1.py  ``` to run the site using the virtual env
- Your terminal will confirm when the hosting is successful and provide a link ( eg http://127.0.0.1:8000 ) that you can alt-click to open the browser
- From here can see the app with two functioning pages controlled by a parent navigation bar, with working links
